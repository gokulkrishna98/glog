Hi, I am Gokul, I am interested in Machine Learning, High performance computing and Compiler Optimizations. Former Senior Engineer at Samsung Research under CPU, GPU and Compiler Team for Neural Acceleration with 3 years of experience, currently pursuing masters in computer science @ NYU Courant.

I have experience in OpenCL GPU kernels, Apache TVM framework, Tensorflow and ArmNN and optimized lot of USP use cases for Flagship Galaxy Devices. My Passion currently lies in exploring the Neural Accelerators and Compilers.
